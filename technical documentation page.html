              <p>Clean and safe water is essential for human health, but unfortunately, not everyone has access to it. Waterborne diseases are a significant global concern, affecting millions of people every year.
              When referencing the environment, there are several diseases that could result from contamination in some way. Waterborne diseases, in particular, are a great example. Typically, many develop from human and animal waste. What is concerning is clear water can still contain pollutants. For instance, water can contain metal, which can lead to organ damage and birth defects.
              An individual suffering from a waterborne disease may experience several symptoms such as fever, cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, each disease can produce different symptoms and can last longer than others. In addition, individuals receive specific treatments based on the disease. Therefore, it is extremely important to receive early treatment.</p>

             Lack of clean water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are major causes for the spread of waterborne diseases in a community.<p1> The fecalâ€“oral route is a disease transmission pathway for waterborne diseases. </p1><p>Poverty also increases the risk of communities to be affected by waterborne diseases. For example, the economic level of a community impacts their ability to have access to clean water.</p><p2> Less developed countries might be more at risk for potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases but more developed regions also are at risk to waterborne disease outbreaks</p2>

              <ul>
                <li><br>Faecal-oral transmission: Pathogens from human or animal faeces enter water sources, contaminating them. This can happen through inadequate sanitation, improper sewage disposal, or the proximity of water sources to sewage or livestock.</li>
                <li>
Contaminated water sources: Natural water bodies like lakes, rivers, and ponds can become contaminated if they are exposed to sewage or industrial waste.</li>
<li>Inadequate water treatment: Insufficient or ineffective water treatment processes can fail to eliminate harmful pathogens, allowing them to remain in the water supply.  Unfortunately many parts of the developing world still lack adequate water sanitation facilities and have no choice but to drink from poorly sanitised water sources. </li>
<li>Inadequate personal hygiene:<br> Poor personal hygiene practices, such as not washing hands properly, can contribute to the spread of waterborne diseases.</li>

 Wash your hands with soap. Consume hot and fully cooked meals. If you wish to eat salad, choose fruits and vegetables that you can wash, peel, and cut yourself. Only drink the water if you know its source.

Common cholera treatment includes rehydration (drinking lots of water and ORS), intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and zinc supplements</li></ul>

              <p>We can prevent the spread of waterborne diseases by improving sanitation, treating water, educating people about waterborne diseases, and investing in infrastructure. </p>
